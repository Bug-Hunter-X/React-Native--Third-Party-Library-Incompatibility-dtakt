# React Native: Third-Party Library Incompatibility

This repository demonstrates a common issue in React Native development: errors caused by incompatibility between third-party libraries and the React Native environment or conflicts between dependencies.

The `ThirdPartyLibBug.js` file shows an example of how a poorly integrated or conflicting library can cause runtime errors.  The `ThirdPartyLibSolution.js` file provides solutions for resolving this issue by carefully managing dependencies and ensuring compatibility.

## Reproducing the Bug

1. Clone this repository.
2. Run `npm install` to install the necessary dependencies.
3. Run `npx react-native run-android` or `npx react-native run-ios` (depending on your platform).
4. Observe the error in your console, indicating a problem with the integration of the third-party library.

## Solution

See `ThirdPartyLibSolution.js` for the resolution methods.
