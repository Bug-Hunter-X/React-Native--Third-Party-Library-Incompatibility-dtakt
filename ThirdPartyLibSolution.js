The solution involves several steps to ensure compatibility: 
1. **Check Library Compatibility:** Verify that the third-party library explicitly supports React Native and the version you're using.
2. **Dependency Review:** Examine the library's `package.json` for dependencies that might conflict with your project's dependencies.  Use tools like `npm ls` to check for version mismatches or overlapping packages.
3. **Version Management:**  Try different versions of the library, looking for a version with fewer reported compatibility issues or that explicitly states it is compatible with your React Native setup.
4. **Dependency Resolution:** If conflicts exist, use techniques like `npm dedupe` to flatten the dependency tree. You might need to adjust package versions (or even remove unnecessary dependencies) to resolve conflicts.
5. **Peer Dependencies:** Make sure to install all peer dependencies required by the third-party library.
6. **Selective Imports:** In some cases, the problem might only be with specific components or functions within the third-party library. Try importing and using only necessary modules to isolate the issue.
7. **Platform-Specific Handling:** If the library has platform-specific dependencies, you might need to use platform-specific imports or conditional rendering to handle them properly in your code.
8. **Alternative Libraries:** If the above doesn't work, consider using an alternative library with better compatibility and maintenance.
